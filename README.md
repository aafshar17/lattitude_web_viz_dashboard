# Lattitude Web Visualization Dashboard

## Project Description

Built a visualization dashboard website that has individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The other features are a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
